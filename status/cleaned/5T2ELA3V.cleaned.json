                            "E-bikes have the potential to overcome some of the barriers that stroke survivors face with regards to physical activity. This study aims to explore the factors that affect e-bike usage by stroke survivors.",
                            "A mixed methods multiple case studies design, using semi-structured interviews and GPS data. Subject to GP approval, participants loaned an e-bike or e-trike for up to three months. Interviews were undertaken pre and post intervention. The COM-B behaviour change model acted as a framework for analysis. GPS data relating to journey duration and distance travelled was collected fortnightly.",
                            "Six participants were recruited; only three loaned an e-bike/e-trike (with adaptations as required). Storage, being unable to get GP approval, and safety were withdrawal reasons. Level of impairment was a factor influencing the type of e-bike used, level of support required and the motivation of the participants.",
                            "Stroke survivors can use e-bikes although barriers exist. Electrical assistance was a positive factor in enabling some of the participants to cycle outdoors. Due to the small sample size and the number of participants who were able to loan an e-bike, further research is required to determine whether e-bikes are a feasible and effective intervention to increase physical activity for stroke survivors.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe assistance provided by the e-bike/e-trike could provide stroke survivors the opportunity to cycle outdoors.E-bikes/e-trikes could facilitate participation of activities of everyday living such as shopping, hobbies and increase levels of physical activity.Rehabilitation could focus on physical impairment, its effects on self-confidence, and knowledge surrounding the e-bike to overcome barriers to cycling.Social support, the belief that e-bike was an enjoyable mode of physical activity that was good for their health were reported by the participants as important factors for using the e-bike/e-trike."

        "abstract": "['E-bikes have the potential to overcome some of the barriers that stroke survivors face with regards to physical activity. This study aims to explore the factors that affect e-bike usage by stroke survivors.', 'A mixed methods multiple case studies design, using semi-structured interviews and GPS data. Subject to GP approval, participants loaned an e-bike or e-trike for up to three months. Interviews were undertaken pre and post intervention. The COM-B behaviour change model acted as a framework for analysis. GPS data relating to journey duration and distance travelled was collected fortnightly.', 'Six participants were recruited; only three loaned an e-bike/e-trike (with adaptations as required). Storage, being unable to get GP approval, and safety were withdrawal reasons. Level of impairment was a factor influencing the type of e-bike used, level of support required and the motivation of the participants.', 'Stroke survivors can use e-bikes although barriers exist. Electrical assistance was a positive factor in enabling some of the participants to cycle outdoors. Due to the small sample size and the number of participants who were able to loan an e-bike, further research is required to determine whether e-bikes are a feasible and effective intervention to increase physical activity for stroke survivors.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe assistance provided by the e-bike/e-trike could provide stroke survivors the opportunity to cycle outdoors.E-bikes/e-trikes could facilitate participation of activities of everyday living such as shopping, hobbies and increase levels of physical activity.Rehabilitation could focus on physical impairment, its effects on self-confidence, and knowledge surrounding the e-bike to overcome barriers to cycling.Social support, the belief that e-bike was an enjoyable mode of physical activity that was good for their health were reported by the participants as important factors for using the e-bike/e-trike.']",

                            "Support services for people with dementia are variable depending on the area or town they live. People with dementia and family carers can often get very little support after a diagnosis. Services might not be suitable or they may not be aware of the service in the first place. The aim of this study was to evaluate a socially prescribed community service provided to people with dementia and family carers offering physical and mental activities. People with dementia and family carers were recruited from a community centre in the North West of England to complete in this study. Participants provided demographic information and completed the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale at baseline, and after 3 and 6\u00a0months. Postcode data were used to generate an Index of Multiple Deprivation score for information on participants' socioeconomic background. Data were analysed using paired samples t-tests to compare well-being scores between baseline and follow-up assessments. A total of 25 people with dementia (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and family carers (n\u00a0=\u00a011) participated in the service. Visits ranged from 1 to 36, with 22 and 15 participants completing the 3- and 6-month follow-up respectively. Some reasons for discontinuation were lack of transport and other commitments. Most participants lived in some of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Compared to baseline, well-being was significantly higher at both follow-ups. This is one of the first studies reporting the benefits of a social prescribing service in dementia. Future implementation work needs to design an implementation plan so that the service can be implemented in other community centres across the country."

People with dementia and family carers can often get very little support after a diagnosis. Services might not be suitable or they may not be aware of the service in the first place. The aim of this study was to evaluate a socially prescribed community service provided to people with dementia and family carers offering physical and mental activities. People with dementia and family carers were recruited from a community centre in the North West of England to complete in this study. Participants provided demographic information and completed the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale at baseline, and after 3 and 6\\xa0months. Postcode data were used to generate an Index of Multiple Deprivation score for information on participants' socioeconomic background. Data were analysed using paired samples t-tests to compare well-being scores between baseline and follow-up assessments. A total of 25 people with dementia (n\\xa0=\\xa014) and family carers (n\\xa0=\\xa011) participated in the service. Visits ranged from 1 to 36, with 22 and 15 participants completing the 3- and 6-month follow-up respectively. Some reasons for discontinuation were lack of transport and other commitments. Most participants lived in some of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Compared to baseline, well-being was significantly higher at both follow-ups. This is one of the first studies reporting the benefits of a social prescribing service in dementia. Future implementation work needs to design an implementation plan so that the service can be implemented in other community centres across the country.\"]",

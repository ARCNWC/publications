                            "There is a lack of robust evidence regarding outcomes for day care use among older people living with long-term conditions (LTCs). Day care is provided by independent, private and voluntary and charitable sectors. This systematic review aims to establish current evidence of outcomes for older people with LTCs attending day care services and outcomes on carers, across all service models. Narrative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data was undertaken. The review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic literature search was carried out across eight electronic databases and reference lists of key journals between 2004 and October 2020 were searched. Searches returned 1,202 unique titles. Forty-five articles from 16 countries met the criteria on review of title, abstract and full article. There is limited evidence suggesting improved levels of perceived psychological health, quality of life, perceived general health, physical health and functioning for older people attending day care who have LTCs. The respite function of day care resulted in positive outcomes for carers. Studies evaluating outcomes for participants or carers were limited in quantity and quality. There is limited information regarding outcomes for day care attendance for older people with multiple LTCs from existing literature. Further research focusing on LTCs and day care attendance would benefit this field."

Day care is provided by independent, private and voluntary and charitable sectors. This systematic review aims to establish current evidence of outcomes for older people with LTCs attending day care services and outcomes on carers, across all service models. Narrative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data was undertaken. The review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic literature search was carried out across eight electronic databases and reference lists of key journals between 2004 and October 2020 were searched. Searches returned 1,202 unique titles. Forty-five articles from 16 countries met the criteria on review of title, abstract and full article. There is limited evidence suggesting improved levels of perceived psychological health, quality of life, perceived general health, physical health and functioning for older people attending day care who have LTCs. The respite function of day care resulted in positive outcomes for carers. Studies evaluating outcomes for participants or carers were limited in quantity and quality. There is limited information regarding outcomes for day care attendance for older people with multiple LTCs from existing literature. Further research focusing on LTCs and day care attendance would benefit this field.']",
